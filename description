NST defines the following inputs:
•	A generated image — the image that contains the final output which is the only trainable variable 
•	A style image — the image from which we want to transfer the style that is to be incorporated in the content image
•	A content image  — the image on which we want to perform the style transfer 
How does neural artistic style transfer work?
1.	We take an input image and a style image and then resize them to equal dimensions.
2.	Then we load a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as VGG19.
3.	We can distinguish layers of the CNN that are the responsible for the content (image-specific features) and layers which are responsible for style (basic shapes, colours etc.), we can separate the different layers of the CNN to independently work on the style and content.
4.	Next we have to work on the optimization problem using which we try to minimize:
•	Content loss (distance between the output and input images - we strive to preserve the content)
•	Style loss (distance between the output and style images - we strive to apply a new style)
•	Total variation loss (regularisation - spatial smoothness to de-noise the output image) 
5.	Set the gradients and perform optimization.
